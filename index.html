        Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (born Rolihlahla Mandela /mænˈdɛlə/;[1] Xhosa:
        [xolíɬaɬa mandɛ̂ːla]; 18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African
        anti-apartheid revolutionary political leader who served as the first
        president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first
        black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative
        democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of
        apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial
        reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he
        served as the president of the African National Congress (ANC) party
        from 1991 to 1997.
